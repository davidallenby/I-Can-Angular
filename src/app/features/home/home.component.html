        Thanks for checking out my Angular repo! I set this up as a way to
        guide new Angular devs towards some of the Angular best practices. This repo covers the main concepts of Angular, and how best to approach them.
        I have written up an explanation on each of the main Angular concepts, on the <a routerLink="/concepts">Angular Concepts</a> page. You'll notice throughout the app (content and code comments) that I offer tips and suggestions to common front end problems.
      </p>
      <p>As a fun project, I built the game <a routerLink="/play">Whac-A-Mole</a> in Angular (without having to use HTML Canvas either!). Once you've had a couple of turns at the game, check out the <a routerLink="/play/leaderboard">leaderboard</a> to see who's the current champion!</p>
