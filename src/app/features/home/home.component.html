    This is my submission for the AGL developer test. You will noticed that I
    have gone <em>slightly</em> overboard with engineering a solution.<br/>(That's just because I wanted to show all the awesome things I can do!)
  </p>
  <p class="mb-5">Throughout this application I will explain in comments, content, and code. How, and why I have achieved the end goal.</p>

  <h2>Introduction</h2>
  <p>The developer test was as follows:</p>
  <blockquote class="mb-4">
    A json web service has been set up at the url: 
    <a href="http://agl-developer-test.azurewebsites.net/people.json">
      http://agl-developer-test.azurewebsites.net/people.json
    </a>
    <br>
    You need to write some code to consume the json and output a list of all the cats in alphabetical order under a heading of the gender of their owner.
    <span class="quote-author">
      - Hiring manager, AGL
    </span>
  </blockquote>
  <p>I have completed this task below. However, I have built some extra bells and whistles on other pages. Please navigate throughout the application and let me know of any areas for improvement</p>
  <p>Thanks for taking the time to consider my application, I hope to hear from you soon!</p>

  <app-list *ngFor="let gender of catsByOwnerGender"
    [items]="gender.items"
    [title]="gender.title"
  ></app-list>
