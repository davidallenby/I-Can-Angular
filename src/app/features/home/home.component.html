    This is my submission for the AGL developer test.
  </p>

  <h2>The challenge</h2>
  <p>The developer test was as follows:</p>
  <blockquote class="mb-4">
    A json web service has been set up at the url: 
    <a href="http://agl-developer-test.azurewebsites.net/people.json">
      http://agl-developer-test.azurewebsites.net/people.json
    </a>
    <br>
    You need to write some code to consume the json and output a list of all the cats in alphabetical order under a heading of the gender of their owner.
